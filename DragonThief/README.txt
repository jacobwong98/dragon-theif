1) Choose between Fight against Daenerys Targaryen for the Player vs Player mode
2) Or Practice with Unsullied Soldier for Player vs AI mode.

1) How to play the Player vs Player Mode
In the first input window, Player 1 enters a 5 digits code that Player 2 does not know.
Then, Player 2 must enter their guesses into the next and subsequent input windows.
In the Command window, Player 2 will see their guess, the number of matching digits and the attempts left
From this information, Player 2 must use whatever strategy they need to solve the secret code.
This continues until Player 2 correctly guesses the code or they run out of attempts.

2) How to play the Player vs AI Mode
For this mode, the player will enter their guess into the input window.
Similar to the Player vs Player mode, the same results will be printed in the Command Window.
The player continues to guess until they are correct or run out of attempts.
